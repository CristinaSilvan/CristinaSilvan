# My formation

I've been studying **Computer Science** since 2018 when I first joined the **University**, but due to personal circumstances, I was unable to complete my degree at that time. After relocating to another city, I spent several years working in the hospitality industry and taking on various side jobs. Despite the detours, my **passion for technology never faded** and I continued to chase it **through self-taught learning** via online resources.

My journey took a turning point when I enrolled in a [Cloud Computing summer course at EOI (Escuela de OrganizaciÃ³n Industrial)](https://www.eoi.es/es/cursos/90758/curso-de-cloud-computing-desarrollo-presencial-virtual-online-ambito-nacional), which reignited my commitment to my **career path**. With the savings I had accumulated, I was able to pursue formal education again, this time enrolling in a [Higher Degree in Cross-Platform Application Development (DigiTech)](http://digitechfp.com/fp-grado-superior/dam/). The prior knowledge I had gained significantly contributed to my success in the program.
